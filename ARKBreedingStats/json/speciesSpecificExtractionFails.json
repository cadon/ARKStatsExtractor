  "Gigantoraptor": "The Gigantoraptor is impossible to extract if they've both been obtained from the taming minigame and been imprinted since. It's too many unknown variables. Importing them before imprinting works, although you might need to force ASB into Tamed mode during import. Alternatively their offspring should import fine."
