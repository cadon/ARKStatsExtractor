lbImprintingFailInfo	If the creature is imprinted the extraction may fail because the game sometimes "forgets" to increase some stat-values during the imprinting-process. Usually it works after you put the creature in and out of a cryopod, up- and download it in an obelisk/terminal, go out of render-distance, or wait for a server-restart.
