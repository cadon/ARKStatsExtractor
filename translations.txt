issueCauseArkStatIssue  This species is known to show wrong stat values ingame, this can prevent a successful extraction.
issueCauseCreatureLevel  "Check if the total level of the creature is entered correctly.
If the creature is bred, also check if the BabyImprintingStatScaleMultiplier is set correctly."
issueCauseImpossibleTe  The level results in an impossible taming effectiveness. Did you enter the levels arbitrarily? It might work if you set the creature to bred.
issueCauseImprintingLocked  You locked the imprinting-value by checking "Exactly, don't adjust" and the tool won't adjust it, this may cause the extraction to fail.
issueCauseImprintingNotPossible  "The imprinting-percentage given is not possible with the current multipliers and may cause wrong values during the extraction-process.
Make sure the BabyCuddleIntervallMultiplier and the BabyMatureSpeedMultiplier are set correctly.
They may have to be set to the value when the creature hatched/was born, even if they were changed."
issueCauseImprintingNotUpdated  Sometimes the game doesn't update the stat-value after an imprinting. Try the extraction after the creature was cryoed again.
issueCauseLockedDomLevel  Uncheck all Lock-to-Zero-buttons in the stats (all lock-symbols should be green and opened).
issueCauseMaxWildLevel  The maximal wild level is set too low, go to the settings and adjust it.
issueCauseModValues  If the creature is from a mod, you may need to enable the according mod values in Settings - Mod value manager.
issueCauseOutdatedIngameValues  The stats of the creature were changed recently and the game displays the old values. Level up a stat, that should trigger a recalculation of the values.
issueCauseSingleplayer  If you have enabled the Singleplayer-Settings in the game, make sure the according checkbox is enabled in the settings in this application as well.
issueCauseStatMultipliers  The stat multipliers in the Settings are not set to the multipliers of the server. Ask your admin for the correct multipliers and adjust them in the Settings.
issueCauseTamingEffectivenessRange  Taming-Effectiveness-Range too narrow, increase the upper and / or decrease the lower bound.
issueCauseTypo  Double check if all stat-values are entered correctly.
issueCauseWildLevelSteps  Adjust or disable the "Consider Wild-level - steps" in the settings.
issueCauseWildTamedBred  Make sure the correct state (wild, tamed, bred) for the creature is chosen.
issueMaxWildLevelTooLow	"The extraction is potentially possible, but it seems the max wild level is set too low for a valid extraction. Check if you set the correct value in the settings.
The current value is {0} and this creature seems to have a higher wild level than this.

For other reasons of the failing of the extraction, see the list on the right after closing this messagebox."

lbCurrentTorpor	Current Torpor
lbImprintedCountTT	"Number of cuddles given to get to this Imprinting-Bonus.
Click left to set to the closest valid integer.
Click right to set the imprinting to the value so for the torpor the levels in the tester and the value in the extractor match."
lbImprintingCuddleCountExtractorTT	Number of cuddles given to get to this Imprinting-Bonus.
lbImprintingFailInfo	If the creature is imprinted the extraction may fail because the game sometimes "forgets" to increase some stat-values during the imprinting-process. Usually it works after you put the creature in and out of a cryopod, up- and download it in an obelisk/terminal, go out of render-distance, or wait for a server-restart.
lbListeningTT	"red: listening, grey: deactivated, green: recognized, orange: didn't recognized

lbSumDomTT	"This is the sum of all manual levelups of this creature, it should exactly match the number below.
If it's not matching, click on a stat that is yellow and choose another possible level distribution."
lbSumWildTT	"This is an indicator if the sum of the wild levels is valid.
